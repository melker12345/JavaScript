Caching the Symbols: 
You can cache the list of symbols either in the browser's localStorage (if the list doesn't change often)
or in a session variable. This way, you only need to fetch the full list once per session or less frequently.

Lazy Loading: 
Implement lazy loading in the dropdown. Initially, load a subset of symbols (like the most popular ones) 
and then fetch and add more as the user scrolls down the list.

Search with Autocomplete: 
Instead of a dropdown with all symbols, use a search box with autocomplete functionality. 
As the user types, fetch and suggest symbols that match the input.

Load on Demand: 
Instead of fetching all symbols at once, consider loading them on demand 
when the user starts typing in the dropdown search field.
